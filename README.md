## Comparative Analysis of Split Learning and Federated Learning on IID and Non-IID Datasets Using ResNet18

### Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to conduct an extensive comparison between Split Federated Learning (SFL) and Federated Learning (FL), focusing on their performance and efficacy on both Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) datasets. This comparison will be executed utilizing the ResNet18 architecture.
